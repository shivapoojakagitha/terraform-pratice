Error: Error acquiring the state lock
│ 
│ Error message: Failed to read state file: The state file could not be read: read terraform.tfstate.d\dev\terraform.tfstate: The process  
│ cannot access the file because another process has locked a portion of the file.
│
│ Terraform acquires a state lock to protect the state from being written
│ by multiple users at the same time. Please resolve the issue above and try
│ again. For most commands, you can disable locking with the "-lock=false"
│ flag, but this is not recommended.
