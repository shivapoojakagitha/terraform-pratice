1. by using multiproviders we are creating resources in different regions
<syntax>
provider "aws"{
    regions ="region1----->ap-south-1"
}
provider "aws"{
    regions ="region2----->us-east-1"
    alias =" wish regian name like ---america, austrial,africa,etc"
}
by using alias concept we will creat resourcesin diffrent regions

resource "aws_s3_bucket" "name1" {
    bucket = "pooja-sate-mumbai"
}
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "name2" {
    bucket = "pooja-sate-america"
    provider = aws.america     -----> by givind provider it will take that pariticalar region mentioned in provider in above.
}

note1 : local names should be diffrent for same resource ..
